# AI-Powered-Chess-Agent
AI Powered Chess Agent
Played a pivotal role in the development of a cutting-edge chess agent by extensively evaluating the performance of four algorithms:
MiniMax, MiniMax with alpha-beta pruning, NegaMax with alpha-beta pruning, and Monte Carlo search algorithm.Analyzed the number of moves taken by each algorithm to reach the final state (win/loss/draw) and the resulting final state of the board, for
the determination of the optimal algorithm
